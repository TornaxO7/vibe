# State

It's alpha sofware and "it works on my machine".
I've implemented basically everything I wanted and I'm mostly looking for suggestions/further ideas on how
to improve it or fix bugs. Feel free to create an issue if you have an idea/suggestion or found a bug.

**NOTE:** Since I mostly wrote this software for me, I didn't create a release package. Also please consider that there
could be breaking changes in the future with your config.
