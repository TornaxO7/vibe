# State

It works on my machine :) I've implemented basically everything I wanted and I'm mostly looking for feedback/suggestions/further ideas on how
to improve it or fixing bugs. Feel free to create an issue if you have an idea/suggestion or found a bug (but I can't promise to tackle every idea/suggestion).

**NOTE:** Since I mostly wrote this software for myself, I didn't create a releases since it might contain a lot of bugs for others.
Also please consider that there could be breaking changes in the future with your config.
