# Vibe

A desktop [glava] like desktop music visualizer by using shaders!

# Usage

1. Install `pavucontrol` (or any other tool to see which programs are currently recording and change the source).
2. Compile and run the binary with `cargo run --release`
3. Open up `pavucontrol` and set the audio source (see: https://github.com/TornaxO7/shady?tab=readme-ov-file#shady-audio-doesnt-listen-to-my-systems-audio)

Take a look at the output. It will give you the path where you can tweak some things. To see the changes, kill the process and start it again.
