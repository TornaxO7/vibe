# Usage

1. Install the dependencies (see the [`Dependencies`](https://github.com/TornaxO7/vibe/blob/main/USAGE.md#dependencies) section below).
2. (optional) set the rust toolchain `rustup default stable`
3. Enter the `vibe` directory (`cd vibe`)
4. Compile and run the binary with `cargo run --release`.
5. Your microphone is very likely be catched as the audio source.
   To fix that:
   1. start the application `pavucontrol`.
   2. At the top: Click on `Recording`
   3. There should be an entry (something like `ALSA[vibe]`). On the right, click on the drop down menu.
   4. Select the audio source (often "Monitor _bla_ Built-in Audio _bla_")

# Dependencies

Here's a list of package manager commands which you can copy+paste to install the required dependencies.
If your package manager isn't listed here, feel free to create a PR!

## `apt`

```
sudo apt install rustup librust-wayland-client-dev librust-alsa-sys-dev libxkbcommon-dev pavucontrol
```

## `dnf`

```
sudo dnf install rustup rust-wayland-client-devel rust-alsa-sys-devel libxkbcommon-devel pavucontrol
```

## `nix` (flakes)

You can simply run the binary with the following command:

```
nix run github:TornaxO7/vibe
```

This flake also provides a package for it if you'd like to install it permanently. Take a look into the `flake.nix` for that.
